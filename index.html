            <p class="second-section-Big-text">HISTORY OF CORONAVIRUS</p>
            <p class="second-section-Small-text">The earliest reports of a coronavirus 
                infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute 
                respiratory infection of domesticated chickens emerged in North America.
                 Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn in 1931 made the first detailed report
                which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota.
                The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and 
                listlessness with high mortality rates of 40â€“90%.Leland David
                Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly isolated the virus that caused the 
                infection in 1933. The virus was then known as infectious 
                bronchitis virus (IBV). Charles D. Hudson and Fred Robert Beaudette 
                cultivated the virus for the first time in 1937.The specimen 
                came to be known as the Beaudette strain. In the late 1940s, two more
                animal coronaviruses, JHM that causes brain disease (murine 
                encephalitis) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that causes hepatitis
                in mice were discovered.It was not realized at the time that 
                these three different viruses were related.</p>

            <p class="second-section-Big-text">STRUCTURE OF CORONAVIRUS</p>
            <p class="second-section-Small-text">Coronaviruses are large, roughly 
                spherical particles with unique surface projections.
                Their size is highly variable with average diameters of 80 to 120 nm.
                 Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm in diameter.The total
                  molecular mass is on average 40,000 kDa. They are enclosed in an
                   envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules.The 
                   lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid 
                   protect the virus when it is outside the host cell</p>
                   <p class="second-section-Small-text">The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the
                        membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins
                         are anchored. The molar ratio of E:S:M in the lipid 
                         bilayer is approximately 1:20:300. The E and M protein 
                         are the structural proteins that combined with the lipid 
                         bilayer to shape the viral envelope and maintain its size</p>
                         <p class="second-section-Small-text">The M protein is the main structural protein of the 
                             envelope that provides the overall shape and is a
                              type III membrane protein. It consists of 218 to 
                              263 amino acid residues and forms a layer 7.8 nm 
                              thick.
                               It has three domains, a short N-terminal
                               ectodomain, </p>

            <p class="second-section-Big-text">PREVENTION AND TREATMENT</p>
            <p class="second-section-Small-text">A number of vaccines using different
                 methods have been developed against human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
                  Antiviral targets against human coronaviruses have also been 
                  identified such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins. 
                  Drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different 
                  steps of viral replication.</p>
                  <p class="second-section-Small-text">

                Vaccines are available for animal coronaviruses IBV, TGEV, and Canine
                 CoV, although their effectiveness is limited. In the case of outbreaks
                  of highly contagious animal coronaviruses, such as PEDV, measures
                   such as destruction of entire herds of pigs may be used to prevent
                    transmission to other herds.</p>
                    <p class="second-section-Small-text">Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the 
                        person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do
                         not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined 
                         with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the 
                         advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
